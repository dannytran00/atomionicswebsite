I had a lot of autonomy with my project and could steer the direction and architecture without much micromanaging, although this presented itself as a struggle when I got stuck. However, there were always people to guide/advise you if this were the case.”<br><br><h1><strong>What advice would you give someone joining Atomionics?</strong></h1><br>“If you're an eager self-starter willing to learn, you should join the team. Make sure you're comfortable with minimal handholding though.”",
